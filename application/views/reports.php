    		<h3>AI (Artificial Intelligence) in Environmental Protection Market by Deployment Type </h3>
    		<p>Growing environmental concerns such as carbon emission, air pollution, and global warming have surged
			the need for shifting from conventional sources of energy to renewable sources of energy. Human growing 
			demand for resources is leading to land-use changes, depletion of biodiversity and pollution. Weather
			patterns, temperatures, and water availability have been disrupting by climate change, leading to impacts 
			on human and natural ecosystems. An enormous amount of information is available than ever before 
			about the environment which can be easily harnessed and used in an efficient way to protect the
			environment through AI. Cognitive technology enabled by AI is uniquely adopted across the globe for
			protecting the environment.</p>
			<p>WHO estimates that exposure to ambient air pollution causes around 4.2 million mortalities across the
			globe each year. Moreover, household exposure to smoke from dirty cookstoves and fuels causes around
			3.8 million mortalities every year. The organization further estimates that 91% of the global population
			lives in places where air quality exceeds WHO guideline limits. Air pollution has been a major concern for
			the communities across the globe and the effect of it can be reduced significantly by adopting clean 
			household fuels and technologies. Furthermore, prioritizing rapid urban transit, walking, and cycling 
			networks, energy-efficient buildings and urban design, improved waste management, and electricity 
			production from renewable power resources will aid in reducing air pollution. Moreover, the use of AI 
			enabled technology are uniquely used to monitor and reduce energy and water consumption, thereby 
			driving the market growth.</p>
